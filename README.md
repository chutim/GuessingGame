# GuessingGame

This was a small project I completed as part of the prep coursework before the Fullstack Academy Software Engineering Immersive program began. While there was guidance for the logic and general setup of the game, it was my first experience designing a user interface - including my first attempts at utilizing CSS and HTML. I strove to create something engaging, visually pleasing, and intuitively functional.

The final result is hosted on Github Pages here: https://timchu92.github.io/GuessingGame/
